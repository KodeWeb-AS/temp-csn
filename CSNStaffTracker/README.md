- Start the API server with `npm run api` or `npm run dev-api` (for development)
- The API provides the following endpoints:
  - `/api/health-check` - For checking API connectivity

  - `/api/staff/{id}` - For getting/updating a specific staff member
  - `/api/staff/eligible-promotions` - For getting promotion-eligible staff
